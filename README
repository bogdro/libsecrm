This is the README file for libsecrm, a library which ensures
 secure removing of files on the system.

Requirements for compiling:

- a non-root account. Please, NEVER compile or 'make' anything as root.

- a working C compiler

- development package for the C library (like glibc-devel and glibc-headers)
  with the signal.h and (especially) fcntl.h, unistd.h and sys/stat.h headers.

  The unistd.h contains functions needed for wiping to work at all. Nothing
  will be done if this file is missing.

  The sys/stat.h contains functions needed to check the wiped object's type.
  Libsecrm will wipe only regular files. If this file is missing, nothing can
  be wiped.

  The dlfcn.h header contains functions needed to call the original functions.
  It has to have RTLD_NEXT defined. Libsecrm wouldn't work without this, so it
  won't compile without this.

  The fcntl header has functions needed to prevent wiping files that are
  set to be deleted, but still open. It has to have F_SETLEASE, F_GETSIG and
  F_SETSIG defined in it (this is available on GNU/Linux, but may not be
  available everywhere) for this feature to work.
  Libsecrm will work without this, but strange things may happen. If you don't
  have this, put /bin/bash in the program ban file and "ICE" (without the
  double quotes) in the file ban file (read the "Manual configuration" chapter
  in the "info" documentation).

- libdl, the dynamic loading library, with its development package
  (unless the required functions are in the C library)

- the 'make' program

Type './configure' to configure the program for your system.

Type 'make' to compile the program.
Documentation comes complied (you can copy it right away), but can be changed
 and recompiled, if you have the 'makeinfo' program ('texinfo' package).

Type 'make install' to install the program.

Type 'info libsecrm' (after installation) or 'info doc/libsecrm.info'
(before installation) to get help.

=======================================================

Building an RPM package:

1) copy the libsecrm.spec file to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
2) copy the source package libsecrm-XX.tar.gz to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
3) type
	rpmbuild -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/libsecrm.spec
4) get the rpms from /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 and /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS
