	* libsecrm version 0.3
	* Switched to GPLv3. New compile macro 'BUF_SIZE' in CFLAGS available.
	  Using #pragmas for better compile-time error checking.
	* lsr_truncate.c: Checking if file is regular or a link instead
	  of checking simply for non-directories. Memory leaks fixed.
	  One function for all actions. Making 'buf' and 'seleced' local
	  helps process/thread-safety. No action is taken if stat() is not
	  available, stat() returns error or file is not a regular file/link.
	  Portability corrections. More error checking.
	* lsr_unlink.c: Portability corrections. Using stat64/lstat64/fstat64,
	  if the system uses it. Single function for renaming files. Renaming
	  done only if action will be taken, not unconditionally.
	  Workaround an issue with Kate/DCOP: if file name matches
	  ".ICEauthority", the file is NOT wiped and NOT truncated.
	* lsr_unlink.c (unlink): No action is taken if lstat() is not
	  available, lstat() returns error or file is not a regular file.
	* libsecrm.h: Better compile-time macro 'PASSES' handling.
	* lsr_opens.c (freopen, freopen64): Using ftruncate/64 instead of
	  truncate/64, because the file may have been opened in some kind
	  of exclusive mode and normal truncate would fail as it would need
	  to open the file once more. This also doesn't increase the number
	  of file handles associated with the same file. If getting the file
	  descriptor fails, truncate/64 is used.
	* lsr_truncate.c (truncate/64): using open() if fopen() fails.
	* doc update with full texts of licences.

	* libsecrm version 0.2.
	* lsr_unlink.c (unlink, unlinkat): Bugs fixed.
	* lsr_unlink.c: Better error handling. Memory checks.
	* lsr_opens.c: Better error handling.

2007-07-08	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* First release of libsecrm, version 0.1.

	  versions of these, if needed).
